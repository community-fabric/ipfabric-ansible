# You can specify ways to convert a collection name (<namespace>.<name>) to an URL here.
# You can replace either of <namespace> or <name> by "*" to match all values in that place,
# or use "*" for the collection name to match all collections. In the URL, you can use
# {namespace} and {name} for the two components of the collection name. If you want to use
# "{" or "}" in the URL, write "{{" or "}}" instead. Basically these are Python format
# strings (https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/string.html#formatstrings).

# The same wildcard rules and formatting rules as for collection_url apply.
